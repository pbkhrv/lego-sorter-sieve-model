# lego-sorter-sieve-model
This is an OpenScad model of a sieve mesh to sort LEGO bricks by size, inspired by this [Bricks StackExchange post](https://bricks.stackexchange.com/a/1652).

## How to use this model
Load in OpenScad and change the call to "mesh(...)" to suite your needs, then export into STL and print on your 3D printer.

## What to do with this
1. Find 3 stackable drawers of the same size
2. Cut out rectangular holes in the bottom of the top-most and the middle drawers
3. 3D print a 30mm hole size version of the mesh and insert it into the bottom of the top-most drawer
4. 3D print a 15mm hole size version of the mesh and insert it into the bottom of the middle drawer
5. Stack the drawers. Pour LEGO bricks into the top drawer, gently shake the drawers, watch some small pieces fall all the way to the bottom, with middle-sized pieces get stuck in the middle drawer.

## What it looks like
